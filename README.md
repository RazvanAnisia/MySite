# Personal Website
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ec1546ac-d083-41a9-8107-780c3b98fbd7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/focused-dijkstra-0cf8d1/deploys)

This is the first ever fully-deployed website I put live in my web-development journey. <br>
Learned a ton while building it! ðŸ˜„

### About the project

The build tools used are Gulp.js and PostCSS, it also uses a bit of jQuery as it was very handy when I started studying DOM manipulation.

It is a static website, built just with JS and CSS, which makes it very lightweight and easy to host I guess! ðŸ˜ƒ

It's sole purpose is to show some of the projects I was working on at the time it was built, and present some contact information. 

### What does the future hold?
There are plans for for v.2 , possibly using Gatsby.js!(**React.js, GraphQL, Netlify CMS**) <br>
Possibly creating a blog section as well, and adding some new projects to the portfolio.
Stay tuned folks! ðŸ‘€
